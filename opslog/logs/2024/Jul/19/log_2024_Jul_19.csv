19/Jul/24,14:25:30,Sat 2,HPA,ZAE,Successfully fixed the readBatchFile method. It will no longer read in the Database into the GUI multiple times in a row. Next I will add time filters and change to invidual csv logs for each entry. I will change the log file format to include the time of log this will increase file search speed.
